Our soaps are simple, handmade at home and good for your skin and the planet. Our ingredients are hypoallergenic and allergy/sensitive friendly. While colours, scents and consistency may vary by batch due to natural or seasonal ingredients, our soaps are typically made from:

- Coconut fat
- Shea butter
- Beeswax
- Olive oil
- Castor oil
- Lye, made from:
	- Sodium Hydroxide
	- Aqua
	- Sodium Lactate
- Honey
- Lavender (or rose, chamomile, etc. essential oil (food-grade)
- Dried solid herbs, e.g. Lavender flowers, cinnamon, rose petals
- Organic food colouring

The exact amounts and specific scents/ornaments will vary between each unique soap, but you can rest assured that all are high-quality natural ingredients, often from locally-grown sources!

## PS.
While our soaps may smell good enough to eat, **they are not edible**. They are intended for external use only. Do not store them on easily discoloured cloths or woods.
