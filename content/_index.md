Homegrown ingredients. Exotic scents. Skill, passion, and a love of cleanliness. ❤ Love. 

These are what go into our [handmade soaps]({{<  ref catalogue.md >}}). We started from our own kitchen, in a return-to-nature moment inspired by long hikes through the English countryside outside our back door.

## Where to buy?
You can find our beautiful soaps in the [Wells Cathedral Gift Shop](https://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/your-visit/shop-cafe/cathedral-shops-and-box-office/), as well as contact us directly to order or occasionally at the Wednesday and Saturday Wells market. We're a young business, currently setting up our online storefront. 

We believe we can clean our hands, dishes, hearts and socks while also keeping the world clean. Bubbling with joy,

 
– *Joe & Nancy*

## PS. 
We also have a more detailed [ingredients list]({{< ref "ingredients.md" >}}), all natural and hypoallergenic! If you'd like to try soapmaking yourself, we sometimes [run workshops]({{< ref timetable.md >}}).
